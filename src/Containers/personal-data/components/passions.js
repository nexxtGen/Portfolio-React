            <p>Of course, in addition to creating modern web applications:)</p>
            <p>History of ancient Japan and China. Especially its military and cultural side. I admire the people of those times. 
            Their peace of mind. Their pursuit of perfection. Life wisdom and values that have been guided by dozens of generations.

                My other interest that I would like to tell you about is new technologies. 
                In particular, their impact on man. How technology changes us. Where it leads. 
                How have we changed in the space of recent years through technical innovations. Regarding technology and its future, I like cyberpunk culture. 
                A vision of the future world that awaits us.

                From physical activity areas, I train kumite karate. I often go swimming to the pool. 
                Sometimes I run late in the evening to relax and sleep well. 
                I have other areas of interest, maybe I will tell you about them on another occasion.
